Blender Addon: Straight Skeleton

### Straight Skeleton
Calculates the roof model of the [straight skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton) form the selected polygon (face of a mesh or poly spline of a curve).

### Slice Mesh
Works like the loop cut tool but it is based on the geometry not the topology.
Use the 3D cursor to define the pivot and orientation of the slice planes.
